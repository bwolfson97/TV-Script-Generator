# TV-Script-Generator
The 3rd project of my Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. I use Tensorflow to build a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and train it out a dataset of The Simpsons scripts in order to generate completely new text!

Starter code available [here](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning/tree/master/tv-script-generation).
